### Notes

-   Sometimes, I receive the following error:

    ```none
    400 Bad Request

    {
        "error": "invalid_grant",
        "error_description": "Refresh token revoked"
    }
    ```

### Theory

-   I suspect, the refresh token can only be used once?

-   I suspect, that this is because I changed my password?
