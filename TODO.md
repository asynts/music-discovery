### Features

I have a feature stop for now!

-   There are several race conditions in the application, resolve that.

-   Create a proper design and put some effort in.

-   Search for the root artist.

-   Group API calls together (e.g. fetch bookmark.)

    I get a `429 Too Many Requests` currently.

-   Allow playing song again by clicking on them.

-   Sometimes, Spotify returns `503 Service Unavailable`, deal with that.

-   Play whole songs.

-   Handle authentication errors.

-   Systematically enumerate possible failure cases.

-   Make the deploy script faster by using parallel uploads.

-   Delete old files when deploying.

### Tweaks

-   Make a screenshot that can be shown on Github without blur or scrolling.
    Currently, the normal version isn't readable and if you click on it, you need to scroll.
    It just needs to be much smaller.
