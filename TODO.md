### Features

I have a feature stop for now!

-   There are several race conditions in the application, resolve that.

-   Create a proper design and put some effort in.

### Tweaks

-   Only register if user clicks on the text (`<div>` automatically takes whole width.)

-   Do not allow the user to select text without holding `ALT`.
    I think this can be done with `user-select: none`.
